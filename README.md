# Student Management System

## This is a simple API for:

* creating a unified interface for keeping track of freeCodeSchool students
* accounts for students to login and see their own pages
* admins can login and see everyone via the Django admin interface
* it will be able to use Github OAuth

## About the Program

* freeCodeSchool is a non-profit coding program that teaches people coding basics for free.
* It's set up to offer 3-month long classes in two different levels, 1 and 2. When students pass level 1 - HTML, CSS, and JS, they can move onto level 2 - Node, Express, and Mongo.
